### Abstract 

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has lately arised as a promising tool for monitoring and tracking viral pathogens in communities. 
In this study, we analysed WBE's role as multi-pathogen surveillance strategy to co-detect the presence of several viral illness causative agents. 
Thus, an epidemiological study was conducted from October 2021 to February 2023 to estimate the weekly levels of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 
Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV), and Influenza A virus (IAV) in influent wastewater samples (n = 69). In parallel, a one-year study (October 2021 to October 2022) 
was performed to assess the presence of pathogenic human enteric viruses. Besides, monitoring of proposed viral fecal contamination indicators crAssphage and Pepper 
mild mottle virus (PMMoV) was also assessed, along with plaque counting of somatic coliphages. Genetic material of rotavirus (RV), human astrovirus (HAStV), 
and norovirus genogroup I (GI) and GII was found in almost all samples, while HAV and HEV only tested positive in 3.77 % and 22.64 % of the samples, respectively. 
No seasonal patterns were overall found for enteric viruses, although RVs had a peak prevalence in the winter months. All samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 
with a mean concentration of 5.43 log genome copies per liter (log GC/L). The tracking of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) was performed 
by both duplex RT-qPCR and next generation sequencing (NGS). Both techniques reliably showed how the dominant VOC transitioned from Delta to Omicron during 
two weeks in Spain in December 2021. RSV and IAV viruses also peaked in winter months with mean concentrations 6.40 and 4.10 log GC/L, respectively. Moreover, 
the three selected respiratory viruses strongly correlated with reported clinical data when normalised by wastewater physico-chemical parameters and presented 
weaker correlations when normalising sewage concentration levels with crAssphage or somatic coliphages titers. Finally, predictive models were generated for each 
respiratory virus, confirming high reliability on WBE data as an early-warning system and communities illness monitoring system. Overall, this study presents WBE 
as an optimal tool for multi-pathogen tracking reflecting viral circulation and diseases trends within a selected area, its value as a multi-pathogen early-warning tool stands out due to its public health interest.
